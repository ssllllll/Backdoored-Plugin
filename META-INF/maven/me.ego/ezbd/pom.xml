       We use Maven to build our plugin and Maven uses pom.xml to configure
       itself.

       This file is the heart and matter of everything that has to do
       with how your plugin connects with other libraries and exports itself
       when you want to publish it.

       Please only edit options below, as the above declaration is machine
       generated and not intended for user changes.

       The Group ID represents the main package of your plugin

       The Artifact ID represents the name of your plugin.
       Traditionally, it is suggested to keep this name lowercase.
       If your plugin uses spaces, please replace them with dashes (-) instead.

       The Name represents the full name of your plugin

       The Version is current version of your plugin. You want to update this continuously

       plugin.yml folder there for example usage.

       reference below in the dependencies section.

       Each repository has two parts - the id and url. The id does not
       really matter, however the URL must contain a valid Maven repository
       where the dependency is "installed" (that's why we call the goal "install"
       because we want to install our plugin on our PC as well so that we can
       use it in our other plugins together without linking it as a dependency)

       By default we use the Spigot repository for Spigot and the central Maven
       repo for many other plugins.
