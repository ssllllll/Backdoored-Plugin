## Backdoored-Plugin

This is a Java plugin for anarchic servers, it contains just the backdoor part so dont annoy me on issues asking for something else, you can download the src or you can download the release.




## Why are the files on a .class??

Well, im dumb af and deleted the src from my pc so i grab the .jar and maked it a .zip and then just placed the code here :P (If you think i just stealed it you can believe whatever you want idgaf)
