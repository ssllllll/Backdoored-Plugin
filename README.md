## Backdoored-Plugin

This is a Java plugin for anarchic servers, it contains just the backdoor part so dont annoy me on issues asking for something else, you can download the src or you can download the release.




## How to build the src

Honestly i dont know, i used maven and a friend helped me, sorry!
